# React + Vite

A sillier version of the previous Silly News, barebones for now and lacking main functions such as:
- Utilising DummyJSON to display articles (fetch title, author, contents and a placeholder image to present)
X Allowing users to submit articles into local storage for display into a seperate section of news (User Submitted)
X Toast messages appearing on creation of articles
X (partially) Allowing removal of user-created articles, but not DummyJSON ones
